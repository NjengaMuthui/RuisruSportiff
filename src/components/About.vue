      <strong>Ruiru Sportiff football club</strong>
      was founded and formed in December 2018 with 8 players and started
      training in January 2018 for the preparations of the league. The club has
      organically grown to over 50 players from all ages. We have different age
      groups represented in the club. Under 10, under 15, and also senior
      representation who are under 30. As of this season we have also laid
      foundations in creating an opportunity for disabled members of the
      community to get involved in playing the world’s most popular sport. We
      have a passionate and dedicated committee that continually strive to
      improve the club and ensure it is a successful part of the community. It
      is our goal to continually improve the club’s achievements on and off the
      field and to encourage the whole community to get involved with our
      beloved sport and join our family. Ruiru Sportiff Football Club is an
      established football club in the region, with teams in most junior and
      senior ranks we are able to provide children with the opportunity to
      progress into competitive football with a spirit of sportsmanship whilst
      ensuring they are having fun. As a club we have doubled a participating
      juniors for the 2021/2022 season. Junior football includes the active
      participation of families of Ruiru Sportiff Football Club and the
      opposition in the roles of spectators and performing match day duties.
      These families and spectators will be actively engaged by our sponsor
      brands throughout the football season. From our humble beginnings, we have
      grown in line with the phenomenal growth in the popularity of the sport of
      football itself in Ruiru. In fact, the growth in the club’s player
      membership has even accelerated over the last 4 months, where membership
      has more tripled from 18 members in 2018 to over 50 members in 2022. Ruiru
      Sportiff is run by a sound and capable management committee of 2 people
      who have volunteered their time and energy to support the players and
      community, with another 6 volunteer coaches and managers at all levels of
      play. Apart from catering for all age groups, the club has a huge focus on
      the youth contingent. They represent a large part of why the club exists.
      They are a most important part of what we do today, and will play a vital
      role in where we go tomorrow as a club. For our juniors, Ruiru Sportiff is
      dedicated to providing a positive football experience for children and
      adults of all skill levels between the ages of 6 and 30. Being involved in
      our youth football program draws players, parents, coaches, and the
      community together into one big “family”, centered around a common love
      for the game.
